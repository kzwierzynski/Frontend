# Frontend
Some projects include technologies not supported in all of the browsers (eg. CSS Grid),
so not on all browsers user can experience full functionality.

Only in some projects broad browser compatibility was my aim, 
in others my aim was to try out different possibilities coming from a given approach.

To fully experience functionality of the projects I advise to use Google Chrome.

Thank you for visiting my repository and have a great day!
